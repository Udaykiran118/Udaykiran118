# German Traffic Sign Classification Using CNN and Keras
**In this project, I used Python and TensorFlow to classify traffic signs.**

**Dataset used: [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
This dataset has more than 50,000 images of 43 classes.**

**96.06% testing accuracy.**
Download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BGDHe6qQwrBEgnl-tXTSKo6TvDj8U3wS/view). This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32.

We already have three `.p` files of 32x32 resized images:
- `train.p`: The training set.
- `test.p`: The testing set.
- `valid.p`: The validation set.
